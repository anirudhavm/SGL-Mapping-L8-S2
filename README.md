# SGL-Mapping-L8-S2
Public repository for publishing the scripts that were used for mapping lakes and estimating depths over DML using Landsat8 and Sentinel2 products. 

There are 2 sets of Scripts, identified by prefix 'L8' and 'S2'. These scripts can be respectively used for preprocessing of L8 and S2 scenes, 
mapping of water bodies (lakes) and estimating their depths using Pope et al. (2016) physically based radiative transfer model.

Use 'l8_preprocess_and_depth.m' for Landsat8 products
Use 's2_preprocess_and_depth.m' for Sentinel2 products 

After downloading the scenes from respective data hubs, unzip then and change the location of the unzipped folders in the scripts. 

In case of any help required, please get in touch at anirudha.mahagaonkar@npolar.no. 

These scripts were created with help of published scripts from Moussavi et al. (2020) and Dell et al. (2020).
